A game of checkers created with an implementation of two AI opponents, a working alpha-beta pruning player, and a semi-functioning reinforcement learning player.
Game is played with instructions given in the terminal, pieces are entered by the 'x and y' coordinates for the selected piece and wanted end location. Goal is to take all the opposing player's pieces.
Alpha-beta player is fully initialized and works as expected, even able to play against itself usually resulting in a stalemate.
Reinforcement learning player is partially initialized, as this was originally a project worked on for school, of which I ran out of time to fix its issues. Will be updated in the days to come.

F.Y.I.
Currently not entirely done, but is fully playable against both players. There is also the option to have the AI's face each other.
